#  HR Analytics Dashboard – Attrition Analysis

Welcome to my **HR Attrition Dashboard** project! This interactive Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights into employee attrition trends based on various demographic, salary, and job role factors. The goal of this project is to help HR professionals make data-informed decisions to improve employee retention.

##  Project Overview

Understanding and reducing employee attrition is a critical objective for many organizations. In this project, I analyzed HR data and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key patterns and factors driving attrition.

---

##  Key Features

-  **Summary Metrics**: Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Avg Age, Salary, and Tenure.
-  **Filters**: Department-level slicers to dynamically adjust all visualizations.
-  **Visual Insights**:
  - Attrition by Age, Gender, Education, Salary Slab, Job Role, Years at Company
  - Interactive bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs
  - Heatmap of attrition by job role and department
-  **Attrition Breakdown**:
  - Age groups most affected by attrition
  - Correlation between education fields and attrition rates
  - High-attrition job roles and salary segments

##  Data Used

The dataset contains 1,470 employee records and includes:
- `Age`, `Attrition`, `Gender`, `JobRole`, `MonthlyIncome`, `YearsAtCompany`, `EducationField`, `OverTime`, etc.

### Data Preprocessing:
-  Dropped irrelevant and redundant columns
-  Renamed and reordered indices
-  Converted column data types as needed
-  Handled missing values
-  Created custom salary slabs and age groups for better segmentation

##   Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – For dashboard creation and interactive data visualization
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** – For initial data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For pre-visualization analysis
- **Excel** – Dataset management and manual tweaks

##  Key Insights

- The highest attrition is observed among employees aged 26–35 with less than 5 years at the company.
- Life Sciences and Medical graduates show a higher attrition rate.
- Job roles like **Laboratory Technician**, **Sales Executive**, and **Research Scientist** account for a major share of attrition.
- Salary plays a significant role — employees earning under 5k/month show the highest churn.
